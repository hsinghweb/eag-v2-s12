It was manufactured from 1996 to 2011 and introduced in December 2005. Built by Lockheed Martin and Boeing, the F-22 incorporates ground attack, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence capabilities. Originally, 750 aircraft were planned, but the U.S. Air Force program was cut to 195 (187 operational) due to cost and other factors. The F-22 has performed strike and electronic surveillance missions and is a critical component of the USAF. It originated from the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program initiated in 1981 to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon.\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to definitively extract a list of the \"top 10 things\" about the F-22 from the available sources.",

Built by Lockheed Martin and Boeing, the F-22 incorporates ground attack, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence capabilities. Originally, 750 aircraft were planned, but the U.S. Air Force program was cut to 195 (187 operational) due to cost and other factors. The F-22 has performed strike and electronic surveillance missions and is a critical component of the USAF. It originated from the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program initiated in 1981 to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon.\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to definitively extract a list of the \"top 10 things\" about the F-22 from the available sources.",
